 External Video Player app for Windows


This is a simple Video Player designed for windows to be used in Live Production. 

It features a simple easy to use interface for playing out Videos, Still images and Slideshows of images onto a connected fullscreen Extended Monitor.

It currently supports Fullscreen extended monitor playback as well as NDI output.
If I can build a plguin for Godot I will also attempt Decklink output.

The App supports saving and loading playlists.

Currently FFMPEG is used to decode videos. A VLC plugin was tested, but found to be rather buggy.

This codebase is exteremely messy, I was learning Godot at the same time I built this, caution ye who fork...
